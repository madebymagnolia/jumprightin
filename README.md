# Jump Right In: front loading iPlayer with video content

**There is a substantial hurdle between a user and a piece of on demand video: pressing select**. 

Choosing to play a programme or film and committing two minutes (or more) of your life to “checking it out” feels like a gargantuan undertaking in 2017. The result: stalemate.

The concept presented here aims to address the problem by dropping a user directly into content as soon as they launch iPlayer. 

Users can “channel surf” between multiple “in progress” streams and dismiss the (minimal) iPlayer chrome by pressing select if they wish to continue watching. 

If nothing grabs them, they can **hold** select to display the iPlayer menu and browse as normal.
